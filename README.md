# Knowledge Base for MCCS Capstone Class
# Objective
Our project for MCCS is aimed at enhancing the Marines and their families' experiences. We plan to help MCCS by developing one or several dashboards that will help improve their various transactional channels. The aim is to tackle crucial issues like shrinkage and to improve the visualization of transaction data. Currently, MCCS provides uniform experience across its transactional channels, resulting in low customer engagement. They intend to provide customized inter-channel experiences to every Marine based on their individual needs and behavior. Yet MCCS struggles to fully capitalize on first-party customer data and create personalized experiences. Our approach involves a strong partnership with MCCS to create an online tool to show reliable and accurate data.  

The way we address such challenges is to work with a Data Steward (DS) and a Data Owner, Subject Matter Expert (SME). This will entail interviewing the SME to determine the key metrics or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Following this, our team will produce a series of dashboards, which will be developed to enact a narrative that is both clear and powerful. The DS will provide data for these dashboards. If applicable, we will apply AI/ML techniques to refine the analysis of this data, improving the projectâ€™s value proposition. The initial version of our web-based tool will offer interactive visualizations of shrinkage, transaction volume, and return volume. This decision will be made after our consultation with MCCS on whether an ML model can be used to forecast the purchase behavior of Marines or to predict shrinkage based on transactional and first-party customer data. After analyzing the data provided by MCCS, we will decide on the feasibility of using an ML model to forecast the purchasing behaviors of Marines or anticipate shrinkage based on transactional and first-party customer data.
